# Phishing-URL-Detector
With the integration of Machine Learning in detecting phishing attempts, the avenue of its applications is extremely widespread. Malicious emails are a form of phishing attack, which redirects the user to visit unexpected sites or cause computer viruses to be downloaded on the user’s system. The project’s aim is to mitigate the vulnerability of such emails by using an ML algorithm to detect these URLs and notify the user of the possible danger.
